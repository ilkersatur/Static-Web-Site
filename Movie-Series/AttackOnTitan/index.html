                                        <p>A few centuries ago, humans were almost completely wiped out by giants. Giants are tall, have no intelligence, eat humans, and worst of all, they do it for pleasure, not for food. A small group of people escaped by closing themselves in a city surrounded by high walls that were taller than even the largest giants. </p>
                                        <p>Today, no giant has been seen in the city for 100 years. Young boy Eren and his half-sister Mikasa witness the destruction of the city walls by a huge giant. Little giants begin to flock to the city, and the two children watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren swears that he will kill every giant and avenge all humanity.</p>

                                        <p>The Walls (壁 Kabe) were three large structures located on Paradis Island that guarded the remnants of Eldia. They were built by the 145th King of Eldia, Karl Fritz, a century ago using countless Colossus Titans. They stalled the other nations from attacking Paradis, under the false threat that the King would unleash the Titans inside upon the world if they did so.</p>
                                        <p>The Walls crumbled about a century later when Eren Yeager used to the power of the Founding Titan to free the Titans within them.</p>

                                        According to Annie, it was particularly easy for the Female Titan to exhibit abilities similar to those of the other Titans if it consumed parts of them.
